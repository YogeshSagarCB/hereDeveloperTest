1. For checking the http status codes, I have use Rest assured framework.
2. For checking whether Angular is initialized, I am checking whether there is any script tag with angular written in it.
3. Since it was mentioned to check only internal links, I'm checking the links which contains "developer.here.com" in it.
4. To run the script, take a clone, and open a command prompt in the location, run maven test goal(or clean test). The report will be generated inside target folder.
